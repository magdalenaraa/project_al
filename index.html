                <p>Even if it doesn't work out, even if doesn't make sense and you never see me again, can we just be happy now?</p>

                <h3>Hello,</h3>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>I had a short time to prepare this, so i’m sorry if it doesnt seem like its nothing grand or not enough effort. Talking about short time, it seems like we’re always dancing around each other in these fleeting moments, huh? But i hope you don’t mind, because i don’t mind as well. Like you said, just because the time is short doesn’t mean we can’t make it precious, right? As long as we can be happy for that short time, i guess we’ll be okay.</p>
                    <p>When you first asked me why i would stay because i like you and when you asked why do i like you, what do i like from you, i still couldnt put it in words. Well, i guess this is the time i finally can.</p>
                    <p>I like being in a room with you. you make rooms feels good (both in a sexual way and just in general). I like it how we connect each other through dancing, even though this is my first time dancing with a partner (and i probably suck at it, gabisa diatur emang karna selama 20 tahun joget gapernah joget berdua sama orang yg ala” dansa begitu). <br>
                        I like it how we would look each other’s eyes when we dance, or when we’re just talking, or when we just woke up and then cuddle until its noon. I like hearing you talk, sometimes it can be a bit draining but, from there i learn more and more things about you. <br>
                        I like it when you sing and even write a song for me, because aside from the fact that no one’s ever done that to me and it’s so sweet of you to do it, you’re also so fucking talented for that like wtf. I like it when you calm me down whenever it gets too much, i like how gentle you hold me afterwards. I like staring at your long beautiful lashes when you were asleep, and i like touching you gently just like how you like it too.<br>
                        I like it when you do the little things, like holding me making sure im safe whenever i’m about to bump into someone or something, or maybe when you open the car door for me. I like it when you’re acting silly, or being random, it’s cute even if you’ll say that i’m just being bulol for you when you read this.<br>
                        I don't like it when you're too harsh with your words, but i like the fact that it's honest and it can help someone grow and become better in the future.<br>
                        I like the fact that you’re so determined with what you’re aiming for, knowing it won’t be easy, and knowing anything could happen or go wrong. i like how you’d stay strong for it. The lists can keep on going, but mostly, i just like being with you, making moments with you, whether it’s just us cuddling, talking abt random things, and especially, showing our vulnerable sides to each other.
                    </p>

                <p>Though our time together may be short, I hope it brings sweetness to your final moments here in this sick-ass country. I want you to remember the connection we’ve built, a cherished memory that might be nestled in your heart.</p>
                <p>So, <i>would you mind if I ask you to spend this precious time with me as lovers, creating beautiful memories together until we part?</i></p>
